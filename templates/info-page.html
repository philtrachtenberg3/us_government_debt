  <div class="mb-4">
    <p class="lead">
      National debt is the total amount the U.S. government owes to its creditors—ranging from individuals to foreign governments. But the meaning and role of debt go far beyond spreadsheets and treasury bills.
    </p>

  <h3 class="mt-5">💡 Debt in the United States</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The U.S. government borrows money by issuing Treasury securities.</li>
    <li>Most of the debt is held domestically—by individuals, banks, pension funds, and the Federal Reserve.</li>
    <li>National debt grows when government spending exceeds tax revenue.</li>
    <li>Some economists argue that the national debt is not inherently bad—it's a tool for economic stability, wartime financing, and long-term investment.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="mt-5">🔍 A Deeper Perspective</h3>
  <p>
    Graeber suggests that the language of debt often hides political choices behind a façade of inevitability. When politicians say “we can’t afford it,” they're invoking debt as a limiting myth—one that shapes public imagination about what's possible.

  <p>
    What if we understood public debt not as a burden, but as a shared investment in the future?
