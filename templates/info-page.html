    “The fact that we don't know what debt is, and yet it's central to everything, is telling.”

  <p>
    Debt is not just an economic number — it's also a social and political structure. Graeber reminds us that debt reflects relationships, power, and historical context. The U.S. national debt isn't just a fiscal concern; it's tied to military spending, tax policy, and financial institutions.
